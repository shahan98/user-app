# user-app
A MERN User Registration and Login app for Surge Global SE Internship (Assignment) 

# Login and Registration with MERN stack

There are two parts of this app.
1. Server App
2. Client App

## 1. Server 
After cloning the whole project, you need to set up the Environmental Variables in the .env file in the Server. I have used Mongo DB for the back-end so setup your own connection string like 'mongodb+srv://<user>:<password>@devconnector.jwnwk.mongodb.net/test'. I have used JWT Token for authentication as well. So you would need to create a JWTPRIVATEKEY too. Then open the server and run 'npm install' if the node modules are missing. Then run 'npm start' to run the server on port 8080.

## 2. Client
This is a react app with many react libraries for the front-end. I have used express to communicate with Node js and style to the frond-end I have used Tailwindcss.

#Architecture
The software architecture for this project is client-server approach with validations

### I have included the Screenshots of my credentials in the submission document when I have used when I run my app.

## Thanks!
